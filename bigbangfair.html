                <p align = "center" size = "20">We are going to be focusing on an idea surrounding the use of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> (also known as blue green algae) in space for air recyling. Cyanobacteria were involved in the initial oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere, known as the Great Oxygenation Event. Several species, such as spirulina, are also edible, and high in a variety of nutrients. Our project revolves around cultivating these beneficial microbes to provide oxygen to astronauts without the issues of raising plants in space</p>
